Who is 45 CDO W Coy in JTF-Monarch? 

Our 45 Commando bases itself on the recently revealed Future Commando Force that yearns to re-task, re-train and re-focus the Royal Marines into an elite commando force capable of a number of specialised missions such as long-range raiding, special amphibious ops and many other operations that would have historically been given to the SAS and SBS. Within our unit, RM 45CDO WCoy will provide the unit with the much-needed support with more conventional aspects of our special forces missions but will more often than not operate it's own missions in a fully independent role.

Who is JTF-Monarch? 

We are a UK/EU based ArmA III MilSim that pride ourselves in creating compelling campaigns with the aid of real-life international hard-politics and inspiration from prior conflicts involving UK Special Forces. We have a challenging and rewarding selection process that reflects the UKSF Joint Selection Program and the Royal Marine Commando Course. We greatly pride ourselves on our use of extensive skills such as CQB \[FIBUA\], Air-Assault, Close Protection, HUMINT and more. We rely on heavily detailed, intel-orientated campaigns and rarely have deployments / operations with pre-determined endings. We are capable of providing a realistic yet enjoyable operation to our members. Our Operations are every Saturday at 17:30 EST / 10:30 GMT.
